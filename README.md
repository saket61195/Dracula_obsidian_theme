## Credits

I did not create the original Dracula Plus colour palette.
Full credit for that goes to [Dracula for Obsidian](https://github.com/jarodise/Dracula-for-Obsidian.md) 
and [obsidian-things](https://github.com/colineckert/obsidian-things) for his checkboxes.
I have selected colors from the original theme, adjusted them and added additional colors for the purposes of adapting the theme to work with other apps e.g. Obsidian and Notion.
